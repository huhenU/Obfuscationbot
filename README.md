# Discord Obfuscation Bot

## What's this?

This is a Discord Bot that runs a message through a translator a few times, back to English and then returns that.

## How do I set this up?

Edit botconfig.json to include your bot-token and a channel ID. The bot will only respond to messages in that channel to avoid spam.
Also edit index.js to inclued your translator-API-token
