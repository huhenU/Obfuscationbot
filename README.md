# Discord Obfuscation Bot

## What's this?

This is a Discord Bot that runs a message through a translator a few times, back to English and then returns that.

## How do I set this up?

Edit bot.py to include your bot-token and a channel ID. The bot will only respond to messages in that channel to avoid spam.
After starting the bot, change the amount of iterations by typing <<iterations <number>. This can be changed at any time.
